#### User requirements

A summary of user groups can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vF0fT7Dg2AkpaUl2OpPZrqDDo_fCGqFR3G8vRKpZsps/edit#heading=h.4sqwlc8zs33b).

* Run tests automatically when new data arrives
* Run tests on demand for testing, and integrating other systems
* Able to easily write / integrate new tests for testing
* Give understandable quality flags back from tests / system
* Keep enough information from tests to be able to meet different user groups needs
* Keep enough information to determine provenance 


#### Non functional requirements 

* Can scale to meet current/future needs (particularly when larger ammounts of data come in at particular times)
* Run tests in "real time" (at least minimize wait for flags for the most prioritized / basic tests)
* Maintainable for future (simple as possible) while still able to adapt to changes if needed
* Efficient code for the core features / tests
